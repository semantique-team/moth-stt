## E-000 — Mac feasibility benchmark (2026-10-18)

- **Date**: 2026-10-18
- **Hypothesis**: the M5 MacBook Pro 16 GB can fine-tune the shippable ≈ 8.03 M model
  (Whisper-tiny encoder + CTC head) with PyTorch/MPS within the project's time budget.
- **Model configuration**: a throw-away stand-in with the model's exact shape and random weights
  (Whisper-tiny encoder shape + CTC head, V = 1024, 8.03 M parameters, built from
  `nn.TransformerEncoderLayer`); full fine-tuning step = forward + CTC loss + backward + AdamW,
  on 32 synthetic clips of 10 s per step (mel `[32, 80, 1000]`, 500 encoder frames, 50 targets each).
- **Dataset**: synthetic clips only.
- **Training parameters**: AdamW, single step per setting; fp32 vs bf16 autocast; torch 2.14.1;
  device `mps` and CPU compared.
- **Hardware**: Apple M5, 16 GiB unified memory, macOS; scratch virtualenv (not this repository).
- **Compute and cost**: ≈ 0 (local machine).
- **Metrics**:

| Setting | CTC loss on | ms/step | Audio-seconds/s | Audio-hours/hour | Peak GPU memory |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| fp32 | MPS | 578 | 554 | ≈ 554 | 4.3 GiB |
| bf16 autocast | MPS | **394** | **812** | ≈ **812** | 4.4 GiB |
| fp32 | CPU | 577 | 554 | ≈ 554 | 5.4 GiB |
| bf16 autocast | CPU | 432 | 741 | ≈ 741 | 5.4 GiB |

- **Findings**: CTC loss forward **and** backward ran natively on MPS in torch 2.14.1 (no CPU
  fallback, `PYTORCH_ENABLE_MPS_FALLBACK` unset); bf16 autocast ≈ 1.4× faster than fp32 and
  error-free; peak memory ≈ 4.4 GiB at 320 audio-seconds per step; one epoch over 100 h of audio
  ≈ 7–11 minutes. Not yet verified (checked in the first real runs): real Whisper weights, the real
  data loader, MPS↔CPU CTC parity on a small batch, sustained thermal throttling, throughput with
  key-padding masks and real length distributions.
- **Result**: H2 (≈ 440 h × 8 epochs ≈ 3,500 audio-hours) should take ≈ 5–10 h on this machine;
  H1 under 1 h.
- **Conclusion**: hypothesis confirmed. Torch version pinned to `==2.14.*`; device `mps` with bf16
  autocast is the default for training.
